## 🧪 Lab Details

### 🔹 Lab 2: Control Flow in Solidity
Implemented Solidity functions demonstrating control flow:
- `isPositive`
- `recursiveSum` (using `while`)
- `sumBackwards` (using `do-while`)
- `factorial` (using `for`)
- `stopCountAtFive` (using `break`)
- `skipSumAtThree` (using `continue`)

### 🔹 Lab 3: Token Management System
Built a token system with:
- `view`, `pure`, `payable`, and `fallback` functions
- Access control using `onlyAdmin` modifier
- Error handling: `require`, `revert`, `assert`
- Token events: `Transfer`, `Deposit`

### 🔹 Lab 6–7: Structs and Mappings with MetaMask
Student Management System:
- Functions: `addStudent`, `getStudent`, `updateStudent`, `studentExists`
- Deployment on **Sepolia Testnet** via **MetaMask**
- Used **structs** and **mappings** for efficient data storage

### 🔹 Lab 7: P2P Blockchain in Python
Simulated a decentralized blockchain:
- Nodes connect using TCP sockets
- Broadcast blocks to connected peers
- Handle invalid and stale blocks with validation logic

### 🔹 Lab 8–9: Blockchain with Merkle Tree
Implemented Merkle Tree for transaction integrity:
- Each block computes a Merkle Root
- Tampering detection by altering transactions
- Revalidation of hashes and root

### 🔹 Lab 10: Proof-of-Work Blockchain
Simulated mining:
- Mining process requires hash to match difficulty (e.g., leading zeros)
- Adjustable difficulty
- Validates block hashes and linkage for chain integrity
